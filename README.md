## Overview

LoanLens leverages **machine learning** to generate **real-time credit risk scores**, produce **explainable insights**, and provide **actionable feedback** for lenders and borrowers. By analyzing both **traditional** (credit history, income, existing loans) and **alternative** (social media, geolocation, spending behavior, etc.) data, LoanLens **dynamically adjusts** risk scores to reflect current financial and behavioral patterns.

## Key Features & Unique Points

Below are the **unique points** that make LoanLens stand out. We incorporate these methods and features directly into our ML pipeline, front-end design, and overall user experience:

1. **Dynamic Social Media Analysis**

   - **Implementation Tools**: Time-series analysis (Prophet, ARIMA).  
   - **Feature**: Pattern-based risk scoring, e.g., “User delays utility bills but spends heavily on travel.”

3. **Peer Comparison Risk Scoring**  
   - **Method**: Compare a user’s credit behavior with peers in similar demographics/income groups.  
   - **Implementation Tools**: Clustering algorithms (K-Means, hierarchical).  
   - **Feature**: “User is 10% more likely to default compared to peers in the same income group.”

4. **Explainability through Visual Insights**  
   - **Method**: Interactive dashboards to explain how each feature impacts the credit risk score.  
   - **Implementation Tools**: Data visualization (Plotly, Tableau).  
   - **Feature**: “Social media sentiment contributed 20% to the risk score.”

## Dataset Usage

- We typically **demonstrate** LoanLens using **public or synthetic** data (e.g., **German Credit** from UCI).  
- **Schema**:  
  - *Traditional features*: Income, credit score, loan history.  
  - *Alternative features*: Social media sentiment, utility payments, spending patterns.  
- **ML Pipeline**:  
  - We combine these features, engineer new ones, then train a classification or regression model to predict default risk.
